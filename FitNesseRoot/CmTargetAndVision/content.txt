My vision is, to be able to distribute configuration as code    
  1 to servers      
    1 my own ones,
    2 to my customers servers also
  2 to ide's for poeple sitting all over the world
    1 my employees, doing a office job
    2 my developers, doing a software development job
    3 employees of my customers also

In order to gain a good acceptance, developers should be able, to change, review & pull their configuration in independent manner.

In order to reach a configuration being complete as possible, all common modules should be distributed as OpenSource under Apache2 Licence (maybe Eclipse Licence is also feasible).
