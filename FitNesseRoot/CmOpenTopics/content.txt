!2 Questions to Duncan
  1 Whats tooling you are using for working with clojure?
    1 Do you know, which tooling people are using for eclipse?
  2 Is Eclipse Public Licence compatible to Apache2 Licence?
    1 What would be an reason to prefer Eclipse Public Licence?
  3 What are the first tutorials, I should read for the requirements listed below?
  4 Do you think, the described requirements are achievable?
  4 I've the impression, lein is build in as very central tool
    1 We are using gradle for java builds - what would be the more easy way - support two build tools or adjust pallet to be driven by gradle (support means 10 developers, 10 customers should be trained and supported) ?
    2 I think, build has two dimensions - am I right?
      1 Building Pallet together with my config code (maybe to get an compiled jar out of it)
      2 Running the config
    2 Do you have an picture, describing the lein phases / tasks / targets for this dimensions?
